# learning-c
just me learning basic c 
I just want to learn the basics and make a few small programs 
  (most of my code is private this is not all I made in C)

If you want to try running some of the very simple programs I made you will need to have GTK installed on your system since I made a program to make a simple window with a few buttons to play around with it
