# tui menu

This program opens a first menu listing a few options.  One of them will open a secondary menu executing certain commands on the user's system.  

> ncurses is a very useful library in order to make a user friendly menu.  In this case, I am using it with C, but you can also use C++ for it.  The goal of this simple menu is simply to improve my understanding skills of the C language.
